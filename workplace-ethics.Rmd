# Workplace ethics

## Academic integrity

By joining the lab, you implicitly agree to follow ethical guidelines mentioned in the link below and various links that the following webpage refers to:

http://www.iisc.ernet.in/students-corner/existingstudents-academicintegrity.php

Any violation of ethical guidelines are taken very seriously and may result in termination of your contract/your stay in the lab. If you are not clear about anything, always talk to students in the lab and with the adviser. 

If you are working on a thesis (masters or bachelors), and if you do not follow above guidelines, your thesis will not be signed even if it means a delay in your graduation (THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE, so take it seriously!).
