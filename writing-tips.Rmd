Tips to write short synthesis and critique of scientific papers

Who is your target audience? We are thinking of scientific audience who may not necessarily be experts in the field that this paper describes. 

From the summary you provide, the reader must be able to get a gist of the paper without having read the paper!

Before you write, read the paper thoroughly and have an idea of what the salient points that you want to raise. 

As far as possible write in your own words and do not copy from the paper. Also note that there is no need for you to cite or read additional material as this should be a summary of the current paper only. 

You can keep in mind this outline while structuring your summary
Background of the topic 
Describe what they did + Findings/Results (can also go in at the end of the background paragraph)
Provide your opinion on the paper

To improve the readability, each section should lead into the next one easily. 
Refrain from introducing technical terms, or if you have to pease define them when they first appear.
