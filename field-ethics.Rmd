## Field ethics (mandatory)

First and foremost, please be courteous to all field staff. This is very important. Their needs are just as important as ours, and they have the same access to all field equipment as we do. Share all equipment, food etc with them. 

If you stay in village, please clean accommodation, spend time explaining to village council what you do and thank them for letting you stay. Please be mindful of what you say and do when you stay in a village. 

If you like photographing - please be sensitive when filming or photographing local people, customs and events. First, ask permission! 

Please carry sufficient number of socks so that your friends don't die.

Do NOT collect any biological or physical material.

DO NOT leave anything in the field. LEAVE ZERO footprint. 

DO NOT play music on the field work. DO NOT talk loudly.
